# Running agents

You can run agents via the [`Runner`][agents.run.Runner] class. You have 3 options:

1. [`Runner.run()`][agents.run.Runner.run], which runs async and returns a [`RunResult`][agents.result.RunResult].
2. [`Runner.run_sync()`][agents.run.Runner.run_sync], which is a sync method and just runs `.run()` under the hood.
3. [`Runner.run_streamed()`][agents.run.Runner.run_streamed], which runs async and returns a [`RunResultStreaming`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming]. It calls the LLM in streaming mode, and streams those events to you as they are received.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant")

    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.")
    print(result.final_output)
    # Code within the code,
    # Functions calling themselves,
    # Infinite loop's dance
```

Read more in the [results guide](results.md).

## The agent loop

When you use the run method in `Runner`, you pass in a starting agent and input. The input can either be a string (which is considered a user message), or a list of input items, which are the items in the OpenAI Responses API.

The runner then runs a loop:

1. We call the LLM for the current agent, with the current input.
2. The LLM produces its output.
    1. If the LLM returns a `final_output`, the loop ends and we return the result.
    2. If the LLM does a handoff, we update the current agent and input, and re-run the loop.
    3. If the LLM produces tool calls, we run those tool calls, append the results, and re-run the loop.
3. If we exceed the `max_turns` passed, we raise a [`MaxTurnsExceeded`][agents.exceptions.MaxTurnsExceeded] exception.

!!! note

    The rule for whether the LLM output is considered as a "final output" is that it produces text output with the desired type, and there are no tool calls.

## Streaming

Streaming allows you to additionally receive streaming events as the LLM runs. Once the stream is done, the [`RunResultStreaming`][agents.result.RunResultStreaming] will contain the complete information about the run, including all the new outputs produced. You can call `.stream_events()` for the streaming events. Read more in the [streaming guide](streaming.md).

## Run config

The `run_config` parameter lets you configure some global settings for the agent run:

-   [`model`][agents.run.RunConfig.model]: Allows setting a global LLM model to use, irrespective of what `model` each Agent has.
-   [`model_provider`][agents.run.RunConfig.model_provider]: A model provider for looking up model names, which defaults to OpenAI.
-   [`model_settings`][agents.run.RunConfig.model_settings]: Overrides agent-specific settings. For example, you can set a global `temperature` or `top_p`.
-   [`session_settings`][agents.run.RunConfig.session_settings]: Overrides session-level defaults (for example, `SessionSettings(limit=...)`) when retrieving history during a run.
-   [`input_guardrails`][agents.run.RunConfig.input_guardrails], [`output_guardrails`][agents.run.RunConfig.output_guardrails]: A list of input or output guardrails to include on all runs.
-   [`handoff_input_filter`][agents.run.RunConfig.handoff_input_filter]: A global input filter to apply to all handoffs, if the handoff doesn't already have one. The input filter allows you to edit the inputs that are sent to the new agent. See the documentation in [`Handoff.input_filter`][agents.handoffs.Handoff.input_filter] for more details.
-   [`nest_handoff_history`][agents.run.RunConfig.nest_handoff_history]: Opt-in beta that collapses the prior transcript into a single assistant message before invoking the next agent. This is disabled by default while we stabilize nested handoffs; set to `True` to enable or leave `False` to pass through the raw transcript. All [Runner methods][agents.run.Runner] automatically create a `RunConfig` when you do not pass one, so the quickstarts and examples keep the default off, and any explicit [`Handoff.input_filter`][agents.handoffs.Handoff.input_filter] callbacks continue to override it. Individual handoffs can override this setting via [`Handoff.nest_handoff_history`][agents.handoffs.Handoff.nest_handoff_history].
-   [`handoff_history_mapper`][agents.run.RunConfig.handoff_history_mapper]: Optional callable that receives the normalized transcript (history + handoff items) whenever you opt in to `nest_handoff_history`. It must return the exact list of input items to forward to the next agent, allowing you to replace the built-in summary without writing a full handoff filter.
-   [`tracing_disabled`][agents.run.RunConfig.tracing_disabled]: Allows you to disable [tracing](tracing.md) for the entire run.
-   [`tracing`][agents.run.RunConfig.tracing]: Pass a [`TracingConfig`][agents.tracing.TracingConfig] to override exporters, processors, or tracing metadata for this run.
-   [`trace_include_sensitive_data`][agents.run.RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data]: Configures whether traces will include potentially sensitive data, such as LLM and tool call inputs/outputs.
-   [`workflow_name`][agents.run.RunConfig.workflow_name], [`trace_id`][agents.run.RunConfig.trace_id], [`group_id`][agents.run.RunConfig.group_id]: Sets the tracing workflow name, trace ID and trace group ID for the run. We recommend at least setting `workflow_name`. The group ID is an optional field that lets you link traces across multiple runs.
-   [`trace_metadata`][agents.run.RunConfig.trace_metadata]: Metadata to include on all traces.
-   [`session_input_callback`][agents.run.RunConfig.session_input_callback]: Customize how new user input is merged with session history before each turn when using Sessions.
-   [`call_model_input_filter`][agents.run.RunConfig.call_model_input_filter]: Hook to edit the fully prepared model input (instructions and input items) immediately before the model call, e.g., to trim history or inject a system prompt.
-   [`tool_error_formatter`][agents.run.RunConfig.tool_error_formatter]: Customize the model-visible message when a tool call is rejected during approval flows.

Nested handoffs are available as an opt-in beta. Enable the collapsed-transcript behavior by passing `RunConfig(nest_handoff_history=True)` or set `handoff(..., nest_handoff_history=True)` to turn it on for a specific handoff. If you prefer to keep the raw transcript (the default), leave the flag unset or provide a `handoff_input_filter` (or `handoff_history_mapper`) that forwards the conversation exactly as you need. To change the wrapper text used in the generated summary without writing a custom mapper, call [`set_conversation_history_wrappers`][agents.handoffs.set_conversation_history_wrappers] (and [`reset_conversation_history_wrappers`][agents.handoffs.reset_conversation_history_wrappers] to restore the defaults).

## Conversations/chat threads

Calling any of the run methods can result in one or more agents running (and hence one or more LLM calls), but it represents a single logical turn in a chat conversation. For example:

1. User turn: user enter text
2. Runner run: first agent calls LLM, runs tools, does a handoff to a second agent, second agent runs more tools, and then produces an output.

At the end of the agent run, you can choose what to show to the user. For example, you might show the user every new item generated by the agents, or just the final output. Either way, the user might then ask a followup question, in which case you can call the run method again.

### Manual conversation management

You can manually manage conversation history using the [`RunResultBase.to_input_list()`][agents.result.RunResultBase.to_input_list] method to get the inputs for the next turn:

```python
async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Reply very concisely.")

    thread_id = "thread_123"  # Example thread ID
    with trace(workflow_name="Conversation", group_id=thread_id):
        # First turn
        result = await Runner.run(agent, "What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?")
        print(result.final_output)
        # San Francisco

        # Second turn
        new_input = result.to_input_list() + [{"role": "user", "content": "What state is it in?"}]
        result = await Runner.run(agent, new_input)
        print(result.final_output)
        # California
```

### Automatic conversation management with Sessions

For a simpler approach, you can use [Sessions](sessions/index.md) to automatically handle conversation history without manually calling `.to_input_list()`:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Reply very concisely.")

    # Create session instance
    session = SQLiteSession("conversation_123")

    thread_id = "thread_123"  # Example thread ID
    with trace(workflow_name="Conversation", group_id=thread_id):
        # First turn
        result = await Runner.run(agent, "What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?", session=session)
        print(result.final_output)
        # San Francisco

        # Second turn - agent automatically remembers previous context
        result = await Runner.run(agent, "What state is it in?", session=session)
        print(result.final_output)
        # California
```

Sessions automatically:

-   Retrieves conversation history before each run
-   Stores new messages after each run
-   Maintains separate conversations for different session IDs

!!! note

    Session persistence cannot be combined with server-managed conversation settings
    (`conversation_id`, `previous_response_id`, or `auto_previous_response_id`) in the
    same run. Choose one approach per call.

See the [Sessions documentation](sessions/index.md) for more details.


### Server-managed conversations

You can also let the OpenAI conversation state feature manage conversation state on the server side, instead of handling it locally with `to_input_list()` or `Sessions`. This allows you to preserve conversation history without manually resending all past messages. See the [OpenAI Conversation state guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state?api-mode=responses) for more details.

OpenAI provides two ways to track state across turns:

#### 1. Using `conversation_id`

You first create a conversation using the OpenAI Conversations API and then reuse its ID for every subsequent call:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

client = AsyncOpenAI()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Reply very concisely.")

    # Create a server-managed conversation
    conversation = await client.conversations.create()
    conv_id = conversation.id

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        result = await Runner.run(agent, user_input, conversation_id=conv_id)
        print(f"Assistant: {result.final_output}")
```

#### 2. Using `previous_response_id`

Another option is **response chaining**, where each turn links explicitly to the response ID from the previous turn.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Reply very concisely.")

    previous_response_id = None

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")

        # Setting auto_previous_response_id=True enables response chaining automatically
        # for the first turn, even when there's no actual previous response ID yet.
        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            user_input,
            previous_response_id=previous_response_id,
            auto_previous_response_id=True,
        )
        previous_response_id = result.last_response_id
        print(f"Assistant: {result.final_output}")
```

## Call model input filter

Use `call_model_input_filter` to edit the model input right before the model call. The hook receives the current agent, context, and the combined input items (including session history when present) and returns a new `ModelInputData`.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, RunConfig
from agents.run import CallModelData, ModelInputData

def drop_old_messages(data: CallModelData[None]) -> ModelInputData:
    # Keep only the last 5 items and preserve existing instructions.
    trimmed = data.model_data.input[-5:]
    return ModelInputData(input=trimmed, instructions=data.model_data.instructions)

agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Answer concisely.")
result = Runner.run_sync(
    agent,
    "Explain quines",
    run_config=RunConfig(call_model_input_filter=drop_old_messages),
)
```

Set the hook per run via `run_config` or as a default on your `Runner` to redact sensitive data, trim long histories, or inject additional system guidance.

## Error handlers

All `Runner` entry points accept `error_handlers`, a dict keyed by error kind. Today, the supported key is `"max_turns"`. Use it when you want to return a controlled final output instead of raising `MaxTurnsExceeded`.

```python
from agents import (
    Agent,
    RunErrorHandlerInput,
    RunErrorHandlerResult,
    Runner,
)

agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="Be concise.")


def on_max_turns(_data: RunErrorHandlerInput[None]) -> RunErrorHandlerResult:
    return RunErrorHandlerResult(
        final_output="I couldn't finish within the turn limit. Please narrow the request.",
        include_in_history=False,
    )


result = Runner.run_sync(
    agent,
    "Analyze this long transcript",
    max_turns=3,
    error_handlers={"max_turns": on_max_turns},
)
print(result.final_output)
```

Set `include_in_history=False` when you do not want the fallback output appended to conversation history.

## Long running agents & human-in-the-loop

For tool approval pause/resume patterns, see the dedicated [Human-in-the-loop guide](human_in_the_loop.md).

### Temporal

You can use the Agents SDK [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) integration to run durable, long-running workflows, including human-in-the-loop tasks. View a demo of Temporal and the Agents SDK working in action to complete long-running tasks [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFBZqzT4DD8), and [view docs here](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/tree/main/temporalio/contrib/openai_agents). 

### Restate

You can use the Agents SDK [Restate](https://restate.dev/) integration for lightweight, durable agents, including human approval, handoffs, and session management. The integration requires Restate's single-binary runtime as a dependency, and supports running agents as processes/containers or serverless functions.
Read the [overview](https://www.restate.dev/blog/durable-orchestration-for-ai-agents-with-restate-and-openai-sdk) or view the [docs](https://docs.restate.dev/ai) for more details.

### DBOS

You can use the Agents SDK [DBOS](https://dbos.dev/) integration to run reliable agents that preserves progress across failures and restarts. It supports long-running agents, human-in-the-loop workflows, and handoffs. It supports both sync and async methods. The integration requires only a SQLite or Postgres database. View the integration [repo](https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-openai-agents) and the [docs](https://docs.dbos.dev/integrations/openai-agents) for more details.

## Exceptions

The SDK raises exceptions in certain cases. The full list is in [`agents.exceptions`][]. As an overview:

-   [`AgentsException`][agents.exceptions.AgentsException]: This is the base class for all exceptions raised within the SDK. It serves as a generic type from which all other specific exceptions are derived.
-   [`MaxTurnsExceeded`][agents.exceptions.MaxTurnsExceeded]: This exception is raised when the agent's run exceeds the `max_turns` limit passed to the `Runner.run`, `Runner.run_sync`, or `Runner.run_streamed` methods. It indicates that the agent could not complete its task within the specified number of interaction turns.
-   [`ModelBehaviorError`][agents.exceptions.ModelBehaviorError]: This exception occurs when the underlying model (LLM) produces unexpected or invalid outputs. This can include:
    -   Malformed JSON: When the model provides a malformed JSON structure for tool calls or in its direct output, especially if a specific `output_type` is defined.
    -   Unexpected tool-related failures: When the model fails to use tools in an expected manner
-   [`ToolTimeoutError`][agents.exceptions.ToolTimeoutError]: This exception is raised when a function tool call exceeds its configured timeout and the tool uses `timeout_behavior="raise_exception"`.
-   [`UserError`][agents.exceptions.UserError]: This exception is raised when you (the person writing code using the SDK) make an error while using the SDK. This typically results from incorrect code implementation, invalid configuration, or misuse of the SDK's API.
-   [`InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`][agents.exceptions.InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered], [`OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`][agents.exceptions.OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered]: This exception is raised when the conditions of an input guardrail or output guardrail are met, respectively. Input guardrails check incoming messages before processing, while output guardrails check the agent's final response before delivery.
